<h3>Usage Estimates</h3>
<p>
Illustrative antimicrobial usage values are produced as follows:
</p>

<p><b>A:</b><br />
Limited to countries reporting total antimicrobial usage to WOAH. Estimate for terrestrial livestock based on terrestrial biomass as a proportion of total biomass. Extended to 2020 by assuming the trend from 2016-2018 continues. All components sourced from <a href='https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2022/06/a-sixth-annual-report-amu-final.pdf'>WOAH 2018.</a>
</p>

<p><b>B:</b><br />
Estimate A extrapolated to whole region based on the proportion of terrestrial biomass for the region represented in the countries reporting. Source: <a href='https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2022/06/a-sixth-annual-report-amu-final.pdf'>WOAH 2018.</a>
</p>

<p><b>C:</b><br />
Whole-region estimate for terrestrial livestock from <a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0001305'>Mulchandani et al., 2023.</a>
